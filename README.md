Currently the application has only 2 uses: 

<b>1. Fodder farming -> This code tells you how many more fodders you need to level up and walkthrough maps in order to get
your prefered hero to a 6*. It shows the amount of runs that you need to do as well.

2. Crystal Farming -> Usually players struggle with keeping their skystones in check when a new banner unit is coming out. Usually limited 
heroes are meta changing and i thought of creating something that tells players, how to get the skystones in the time they have left.
This option tells you the arena ranking you need to be, while taking in mind that the banners last a specific amount of time.

This app will have a more commits eventually , and i may turn it into a GUI if the community likes the idea
